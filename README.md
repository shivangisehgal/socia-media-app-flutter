# Social Media App

This is a Social Media UI app built using Flutter.

As for the backend, I have only implemented what was asked in the task:
* **Navigating from one screen to the other** - Click on the post on the home page and it will take you to the comments page. Click on the post picture on the comments page to go back to home.
* **Make the Like Button work on the second (Comments) screen.**
